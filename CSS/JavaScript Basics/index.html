           <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
           <br />
           <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform,object-oriented scripting language.JavaScript is extremly popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and
           lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a bost
           environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environment to provide programmatic controlover them.</p>
           <ul class="list_balck_box">
               <br />
               <li><u class = 'key_word'>Variable Declaration</u> JavaScript variables are containers for strong data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables msut be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <font color = "#6633FF">var x;</font></li>
               <br />
               <li><u class = 'key_word'>Variable Assignment</u> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <font color = "#6633FF">var x = 10;</font></li>
               <br />
               <li><u class = 'key_word'>Data types</u> are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <font color = "#6633FF">true</font> or <font color = "#6633FF">false</font>; null - <font color = "#6633FF">null</font> aka nothing; Number <font color = "#6633FF">-42</font> or <font color = "#6633FF">3.14159</font>; String - <font color = "#6633FF">“Coding Dojo Rocks!”;</font> Array - <font color = "#6633FF">[1, ‘Coding’, 2, ‘Dojo’];</font> and Object - <font color = "#6633FF">{first_name: ‘Jane’, last_name: ‘Doe’}</font></li>
               <br />
               <li><u class = 'key_word'>Conditionals</u> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <font color = "#6633FF">if</font> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <font color = "#6633FF">else if</font> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <font color = "#6633FF">else</font> we execute this block of code;</li>
               <br />
               <li><u class = 'key_word'>Loops</u> There are many different kinds of ioops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
               <br />
               <li><u class = 'key_word'>Function</u> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we
screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
